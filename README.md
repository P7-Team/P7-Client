# P7-Client

This is the client  of Community Computing (ComCom) which is implemented for the first semester of  the masters in software on AAU the client made for interacting with the [Web Service](https://github.com/P7-Team/P7-WebService).



## Setup

To run the application it should be compiled using dot net core 3.

The client is by default set up to interact with the IP of the web service, however as this is not running at all times, the IP can be changed to any other IP.

The default port of the web service is 5000

This is achieved in the config file, which is placed in ``./appsettings.json`` 

The client is started from the GUI project by running the App.xaml
